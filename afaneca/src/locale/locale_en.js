        <p>When I was 14, I created a little metablog that helped others manage their blogs with
            tutorials and content related with blogging technologies in general.</p>
        <p>That blog ended up gaining a bit of traction and I would be frequently approached by people,
            asking me to design their websites in exchange for money.</p>
        <p>
            I ended up working continuously has a Freelancer Web Designer & Web Writer, when the
            jobs were compatible with my schedule. In 2018, I opted out of that work to focus on my
            academic path.

            In the final stage of my curricular plan as a BSc student, I spent a semester working full-time

            software solutions for other businesses.
